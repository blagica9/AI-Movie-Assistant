# üìò Project Description ‚Äì AI Movie Assistant App üé¨

## Overview
**AI Movie Assistant App** is an intelligent web application designed to help users discover movies based on their emotional preferences and natural language descriptions. Instead of selecting genres or applying filters, users can simply describe what they feel like watching ‚Äî such as:

> "I want a sad but heartwarming love story with a meaningful message."

The application uses **OpenAI's GPT API** to interpret the prompt and return a curated list of movie recommendations. These are then displayed in a clean, visual interface where users can:
- Browse movie suggestions
- Like and comment on them
- Save favorites for future reference

---

## Goals
This project is intended to:
- Showcase practical usage of LLMs (ChatGPT) in user-facing applications
- Demonstrate clean backend and frontend architecture
- Implement user interactivity and personalization
- Provide full documentation and serve as a professional portfolio project

---

## Motivation
Current movie recommendation platforms rely heavily on filters, tags, or collaborative filtering. While useful, they often miss the *emotional nuance* a person might be looking for. With the rise of LLMs, it's now possible to interpret **subjective user input** and generate meaningful suggestions ‚Äî bringing a more **human-like** experience to entertainment discovery.

This project bridges the gap between natural language and entertainment personalization.

---

## Target Users
- Casual movie watchers seeking recommendations based on feelings or moods
- Users overwhelmed by the volume of choices on Netflix, Prime, etc.
- AI and tech enthusiasts who want to explore GPT-powered experiences

---

## Key Features (Planned)
- User authentication (registration & login)
- Prompt input for movie suggestions
- ChatGPT integration to process prompts
- Display movie results (via TMDB or custom dataset)
- Like, comment, and favorite functionality
- Optional: Notifications for new or trending suggestions
